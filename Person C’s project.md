# Person C's project
## Task:

> In the main method, ask someone to type the smallest integer they would like, the largest integer they would like (both inclusive), then randomly generate an integer in that range. **Make several simple mistakes in your program.**

*Artem* broke away from the prompt and didn't make any mistakes. But that's ok, because Ethan popped off and fixed it anyway.
